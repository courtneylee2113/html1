<h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
<h2>Courtney Lee</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is Courtney Lee. This is my first time taking an online course.
			I graduated from Sheridan College's Visual Merchandising 6 years ago.</p>
<p> I am currently working as a Visual Merchandiser for an art supply company in Oakville.
I have been working with this company for the last 5 years. </p>
<p> I am hoping this course will lead to the career change I am looking for.
I have no prior experience in website development whatsoever, so I'm looking forward to 
what this could lead to.</p>
